# Pico FIDO2

This project transforms your Raspberry RP235x or ESP32 microcontroller into an integrated FIDO Passkey **and** OpenPGP smartcard, functioning like a standard USB Passkey for authentication and as a smartcard for cryptographic operations.

This is a fork of the last community edition version of the pico-fido2 firmware, from December 9th 2025, that was available on https://github.com/polhenarejos/pico-fido2 before that repository was deleted and replaced by something else.

## Security Considerations

Microcontrollers RP2350 and ESP32-S3 are designed to support secure environments when Secure Boot is enabled, and optionally, Secure Lock. These features allow a master key encryption key (MKEK) to be stored in a one-time programmable (OTP) memory region, which is inaccessible from outside secure code. This master key is then used to encrypt all private and secret keys on the device, protecting sensitive data from potential flash memory dumps.

**However**, the RP2040 microcontroller lacks this level of security hardware, meaning that it cannot provide the same protection. Data stored on its flash memory, including private or master keys, can be easily accessed or dumped, as encryption of the master key itself is not feasible. Consequently, if an RP2040 device is stolen, any stored private or secret keys may be exposed.

## Build for Raspberry Pico

Before building, ensure you have installed the toolchain for the Pico and that the Pico SDK is properly located on your drive.

```
git clone https://github.com/youruser/pico-fido2
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd pico-fido2
mkdir build
cd build
PICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/pico-sdk cmake .. -DPICO_BOARD=board_type -DUSB_VID=0x1D50 -DUSB_PID=0x619B
make
```

Note that `PICO_BOARD`, `USB_VID` and `USB_PID` are optional. If not provided, `pico` board and VID/PID `1D50:619B` will be used.

Additionally, you can pass the `VIDPID=value` parameter to build the firmware with a known VID/PID. The supported values are:

- `NitroHSM`
- `NitroFIDO2`
- `NitroStart`
- `NitroPro`
- `Nitro3`
- `Yubikey5`
- `YubikeyNeo`
- `YubiHSM`
- `Gnuk`
- `GnuPG`

You can use whatever VID/PID for your own personal use. **But remember that you are not authorized to distribute the binary with a VID/PID that you do not own.**
The VID/PID `1D50:619B` is provided to the project by [OpenMoko](https://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/USB_Product_IDs). It can only be used for builds distributed under a free and open source license.

After running `make`, the binary file `pico_fido2.uf2` will be generated. To load this onto your Pico board:

1. Put the Pico board into loading mode by holding the `BOOTSEL` button while plugging it in.
2. Copy the `pico_fido2.uf2` file to the new USB mass storage device that appears.
3. Once the file is copied, the Pico mass storage device will automatically disconnect, and the Pico board will reset with the new firmware.
4. A blinking LED will indicate that the device is ready to work.

To configure your device you can use the [picoforge desktop application ](https://github.com/librekeys/picoforge).

## Drivers

Pico FIDO2 uses the `HID` driver for FIDO and `CCID` for OpenPGP, both present in all major operating systems. It should be detected by all OS and browser/applications just like normal USB FIDO keys and smartcards.
